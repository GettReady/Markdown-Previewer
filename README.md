# Markdown-Previewer
This is freeCodeCamp front end development libraries [project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer). 
Markdown Previewer is a single page application built with React. This Previewer works with the Github-flavoured markdown. 
This Project provides special tools for a faster markdown editing and shows a real time stylised preview of your text input.
